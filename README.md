# battle-ship-venkat-2015

This is an express server that hosts a battle ship game. The server handles basic login, lobby, challenges, and game functions using socket.io, while the client side code is created with the help of angularJS. This project was complete as part of an internet computing course at the University of Houston in the summer of 2015, under professor Venkat S. 

All code written by Keith Dyer. The artwork is from various sources, and is not owned by me.
